# React-Lights-Out-Game
Lights Out is a puzzle game, played on a gird of individual lights, which can either be lit or unlit. The puzzle is won when when all of the lights are turned off. 
You can click on a cell to toggle that light â€” but it also toggles the light above it, to the left of it, to the right of it, and below it.

For CSS, I've used this - https://codepen.io/Trinca/pen/NAvpWa cool Codepen.
